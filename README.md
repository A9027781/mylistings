mylistings Web Application
==========================

This web-application is intened to provide a database of events, promoters and venues that users can search.

The intention is to create a central place that information is available for people to access and share.

Users can easily access the information, which is stored on 3 tables, which are linked.

While the application currently has limited functionaility, the idea is to expand on the options available which helps spread the information. An example of this will be notifications of when a favorited promoter lists an event, through an RSS feed.
